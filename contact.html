        <p>Here is some info about the world's largest lava lake!
        (because I'm extremely fascinated and in love with molten rocks)</p>

        <p>Lava lakes are large volumes of molten lava, usually basaltic, contained in a volcanic vent, crater, or broad depression. The term is used to describe both lava lakes that are wholly or partly molten and those that are solidified </p>
        <p>Located near the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,Mount Nyiragongo is an active one located inside Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nyiragongoâ€™s lava lake has at times been the most voluminous known lava lake in recent history</p>
        <p>It is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting on average every 30 year</p>
        <p>Since 1882, it has erupted at least 34 times, including many periods where activity was continuous for years at a time, often in the form of a churning lava lake in the crater.</p>
        <p>The volcanic activity at this mountain is still going on but it is happening only in the crater.</p>
        <p>In 1977, a deadly eruption occurred when scientists measured lava travelling at a speed of 60 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>Hiking up this mountain is not difficult and reaching the top requires approximately 4-5 hours.</p>
        <p>The volcano is monitored by a team of scientists at the Goma Volcanic Observatory (GVO). It is continuously monitored, with seismic data produced every four minutes and temperature data produced every ten minutes.[20] Continued funding for the GVO is in doubt, as the World Bank decided in 2020 to terminate its contributions.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, political unrest prevents the scientific community from studying the dangerous volcano in depth.</p>
